64-bit DevCtrl version requires that calibration files are in compatible format.
Calibration files of the first version have the extention .WLC,
calibration files of the second version have the extention .WL2;
The conversion is done automatically by running the included SOL_CC.exe, which needs to be in the same folder as DevCtrl.
This program searches for .WLC files in the current folder and then creates .WL2 files from them. .WLC files are also preserved for backup purposes,
but are not used by the 64-bit version.
Newer 32-bit versions of DevCtrl also performs this calibration files conversion to provide consistency. WL2 files are preferred over WLC files if both are in the same directory.
Changes to calibration, that user makes, are only written to WL2 files.
